# Simple example: React, Parcel + TypeScript

This is the simplest possible example of a frontend built with TypeScript and React and bundled with Parcel (v1).

## Serve the web page with live reload

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

## Build the static web page

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The static web page is output to the `out` subdirectory.

You can test it using `live-server`:

```bash
cd out
npx live-server
```
